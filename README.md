> Write logic that can be run asynchronously or synchronously

## Installing

You'll always need `@resync/core`

```bash
yarn add @resync/core
```

If you're interacting with the file system, you might also want `@resync/fs-extra` or [any of the other packages resync has]()

```bash
yarn add @resync/fs-extra
```
